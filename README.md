ict innovation square, data analysis intermediate course practice project.
**(due date: 7/15)**

## Abstract
Inform the member composition of the practice project and explain how each member's role was divided, what work each person carried out, and what the results were.


## Communication
This is a way to communicate for collaboration.

* online
1. Use KakaoTalk open chat. (Name: ICT 7 Team)
2. Use Zoom or Chrome remote desktop.

## Roles
1. Architecture: Design the overall structure and set goals for project progress.

2. Data collection: Analyzing what to collect, developing an API to collect it, and building a pipeline to store it in the database, ultimately building a Data Mart.
 * main feature: API integration and database storage
 * Language: python, sql

3. Visualization: Build a web app / site to conduct analysis through graphs (statistical analysis, probability analysis, etc.) based on collected data and view the results.
 * Main feature: Analysis of collected data, provision of screens
 * language: python

4. Machine learning: The role of creating a model that can predict the future based on collected data is to learn past data, predict the future based on this, and derive the results.
 * Main feature: Building a future prediction model using machine learning. (If time permits, model evaluation)
 * language: python


## Member Detail
Before assigning roles to each person, we listed what each person could do and what they wanted to do, and discussed what role they would play based on this.

1. Yeonjin Kim : Data Collection / Visualization
2. Youngrok Hwang : Machine learning / Tech-Support / Report


## Collection target
We select from areas where predictions can be made with data that is easy to collect, visualize, and analyze.

* Ministry of the Interior and Safety_Statistical Yearbook_Number of heat wave days in major cities by year
* API information: https://www.data.go.kr/tcs/dss/selectApiDataDetailView.do?publicDataPk=15077943
* Currency URL: http://apis.data.go.kr/1741000/DaysHeatWavesMajorCitiesYear/getDaysHeatWavesMajorCitiesYearList
* Examples of analysis usage: number of heat wave days per year in a specific city, number of heat wave days per year in a specific city, city with the most heat wave days per year, the number of heat wave days in the city compared to the previous year,
* Machine learning example: Learn data from 2006 to 2020, predict from 2021 to 2022, and compare and analyze actual results from 2021 to 2022.


## Etc : Weather, subway-related data, crop data (by season)...
